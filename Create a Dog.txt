Create A Dog
Open a new file.
Begin by saving your file. Make sure you save the file as DogBy(yourName).java. For example, my file would be called	DogByNeha.java.
First type public class Dog.
Add braces.
Declare instance variables. You must include the following: private String name, private int age, andâ€¦ Feel free to add more. Think about the properties of a dog (fur color, etc.) Here is an example:

public class Dog
{
	private String name;
	private int age;
	public DogByNeha();
	{
		name = "Lola";
		age = 100;
	}
}

Add methods: bark, growOlder.

public void bark();
{
	System.out.println("woof");
	or
	System.out.println("bark");
}
public void growOlder();
{
	age++; (Use two plus signs instead of one. Ex: age++)
	System.out.println("Happy Birthday!! I am now " + age + "!"); (celebrate!, so 'Happy Birthday!!' when called)
}

BONUS: Make a function that will check if it's a major birthday(10, 20, 30) Don't be afraid to ask for help because it's very advanced, or try to solve this on your own!
